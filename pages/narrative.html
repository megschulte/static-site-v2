          <h3>Narrative</h3>
          <p>In the beginning of this semester, I thought that I had a pretty good understanding of some aspects of digital writing.
          In reality, I had taken notes and developed a basic understanding that was not incredibly useful. This class made my notes
          useful by actually putting them to practice. The single most important thing that I found out this semester was that I will
          not learn any form of digital writing without going through the trial-and-error process.</p>

        <h3>Things I feel proficient in:</h3>
        <p>The following list contains things that I may have been familiar with before this class, but that I believe I could now actually use in
        a future workplace assignment. These are tools that I did not know how to use before this semester and learned through the resources
      provided in class as well as doing my own research.</P>

          <p>These are specific items or functionalities that I did not understand previously and I am now able to use in digital communications, specifically
          in the realm of site-building using HTML and CSS.</P>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In the end, I believe that content carries the load in digital writing. However, the reader must be able to find that content quickly and easily, and if they
        can't find the right information then the content must be organized better. Content should also be written in a manner that makes it easy to repurpose or reformat.
        This class has given me the tools to be able to organize content in forms that are more
        easy to access by the reader and forms that can be more visually pleasing and creative. I hope to gain digital technology skills in the future that compliment what
        I have already learned and allow for quicker content organization and management. My list of things that need improvement give me a great place to continue my growth
        in the topic of digital literacy. I will use my resources on my Personal Learning Network as well as others that I research to continue this growth.</P>
